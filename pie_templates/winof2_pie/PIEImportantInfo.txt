Important Information for Update Packages for Microsoft Windows
########################################

* Do not run other applications while executing Dell Update Packages.

* Do not run storage controller update packages if the controller is in use by other applications. 

  The firmware upgrade may fail if any of the RAID controllers in the system are performing an I/O background task (that is, consistency check, background initialization, rebuild, or reconstruction). Allow the background task to complete before attempting to upgrade the firmware. Patrol Read tasks will not affect a firmware upgrade.

################################
Important Information for Update Packages for Linux
################################

* Do not run other applications while executing Dell Update Packages.

* If the following error occurs, "Error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", you must install the compatibility libraries from "www.redhat.com" or from the Red Hat CD. To install the compatibility libraries, use the following command: "RPM -ih compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-47.3.i386.rpm"

* When Update Packages stop abruptly due to a power outage or abnormal termination, perform the following steps:
   - Remove the lock file.
     Type the following command: rm -f /var/lock/.spsetup
   - Run the Update Package again to reapply the update.

* Do not run storage controller update packages if the controller is in use by other applications. 

  The firmware upgrade may fail if any of the RAID controllers in the system are performing an I/O background task (that is, consistency check, background initialization, rebuild, or reconstruction). Allow the background task to complete before attempting to upgrade the firmware. Patrol Read tasks will not affect a firmware upgrade.

* Linux systems running one or more applications that interact with SCSI devices in certain ways are known to cause a kernel panic situation. Therefore, it is recommended that you stop Server Administrator and its Storage Management Service before running storage controller firmware update packages.

  To stop the Dell OpenManage(TM) Server Administrator service,
  run "omconfig system webserver action=stop"

  To start the Server Administrator service,
  run "omconfig system webserver action=start"

  To stop the Server Administrator Storage Management Service,
  run "/etc/init.d/dataeng stop"

  To start the Server Administrator Storage Management Service,
  run "/etc/init.d/dataeng start"
